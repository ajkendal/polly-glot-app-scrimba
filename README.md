# PollyGlot

A language-learning quiz app built with **Vite**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and **SCSS Modules**, inspired by the Scrimba **AI Engineer Path** project.

## 📚 Overview

PollyGlot is a simple, interactive quiz application that helps users test their vocabulary knowledge in multiple languages. It leverages the speed of **Vite** for development, the type safety of **TypeScript**, the component-based architecture of **React**, and the styling power of **SCSS**.

The app displays a word in a given language and provides multiple choice answers for the translation. The user selects an answer, receives immediate feedback, and can move through a series of questions to test their knowledge.
